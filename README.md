# Developer September Issue 

Created by: Carole Rennie Logan (@crgrieve) & Jamie Hammond (@developerontour)

Insprired by the recent September Issue, we thought let's create a way to share the women who inspire us as coders!

## What to do
* Fork the repo
* Edit the image urls to be the people who inspire you!
** hint: find the "magazine__item"and edit the url in background-image: url()
* Edit the "Guest edited" line to be you.
* Go to Settings in your repo and configure as a GitHub page.
* Share your September Issue with the world!

Tweet us know if you make your own edition, we would love to see them!

Thanks :)
